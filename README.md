# Project Title
Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning And Deep Learning (FYP) 
# Project Description
It is an implementation of our research work. We implemented DT, RF and Bi-LSTM on ARP_MITM and SSDP FLOOD datasets. For RF and DT, concatenated dataset was divided into three ratios: 70%:30%, 80%:20%, and 90%:10% for training and testing respectively. Both models were trained on separate datasets as well with the same ratios.
For Bi-LSTM, concatenated dataset was used with different number of layers. All the models performs very well and had an accuracy over 99% but Random Forest outperform all the models.
# How to use project
1. The files are notebook files so jupyter notebook IDE or Dataspell IDE is required.
2. You can install the dataset from this link. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ymirsky/network-attack-dataset-kitsune

# How to contribute to project
We only trained our model on 19GB dataset out of 64GB because of the limited resources. You can built a more powerful intrusion detection model by using the whole dataset. You can also apply different algorithms and different techniques to increase the accuracy.
